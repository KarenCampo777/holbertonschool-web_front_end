# 0x04. Flexbox

## What is Flexbox?
The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. 

Flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time â€” either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.

## From float positioning to a flex display
Instead of using a float to create layouts by floating elements to the left or the right, flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis. The axis can be horizontal or vertical. It is best used for distributing space for items in the same axis.

- Create a parent container, the - flex-container.
- Once the parent container is created, items inside of the parent container will become child elements, the flex-item's.
- Flex items are arranged in rows by default, but you can change this to arrange the items into columns.

## How to horizontally and vertically align elements using Flexbox
In order to vertically and/or horizontally center text or other content contained in a flex item, make the item a (nested) flex container, and repeat the centering rules.

## The difference between the main and cross axes
the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.
